# bPanel Connection Manager

This is a widget plugin for [bPanel](https://bpanel.org) that makes it
easy to add, update, and delete node connections.

## Requirements
- bpanel v1.0.0-beta
- [@bpanel/settings](https://github.com/bpanel-org/settings)

## Installation

install this dependency if it is not found.

```bash
$ bpanel-cli i @bpanel/connection-manager
```
